## About:
This project aims recreate some of the more iconic inventory systems developed in gaming, such as the attache case present in the Biohazard series, starting with the Diablo series of games.

Inventory Management has always been a key aspect in video games, especially RPGs. When they are designed properly, what was once considered a chore can actually be a more interesting and deeply-involved system.  

The developed program contains all of the necessary elements of an inventory system, such as a personal backpack, acquisition of items from a shop, wherein interaction with these elements reflect unto your playable character as an increase in power, or collection of gold.

 **Note**: This application is designed and tested for Windows systems at a standard resolution of 1080p+
